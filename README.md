# css-to-xpath-converter

The converter uses an extended set of CSS selectors that allows generate more elaborate XPathes.  
Also, it implements non-standard class attribute behavior which has more practical uses than standard one.

It's inspired by [css2xpath](https://github.com/css2xpath/css2xpath), but it is too buggy.

The converter has been tested in Puppeteer and Chrome. See [Test results](https://angezid.github.io/css-to-xpath-converter/test-coverage.html).  
The C# version was tested using an HTML navigator inherited from `System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator`.

**Important:** the converter itself doesn't check validity neither of CSS selector nor of resulted XPath.  
Although the converter is capturing a lot of mistakes, but not all.

See online [converter / playground](https://angezid.github.io/css-to-xpath-converter). It contains a lot of examples and you can also test the validity of XPath/CSS selector and what elements they are actually selecting.

* `s` - selectors
* `n, m` - numbers 
* `t` - text

</details>

## Usage:
``` js
const { xpath, css, warning, error } = toXPath(selector, options);
if (xpath) console.log(xpath);
```

### Output object properties:
* `xpath` - the generated XPath string or undefined if an error occur on parsing CSS selector
* `css` - the normalized CSS selector string (stripped from unnecessary white spaces, comments)
* `warning` - warning message or empty string
* `error` - error message or empty string

### Parameters:
* `selector` - the input css selector string
* `options` - the optional object :
  * `axis` - the XPath start axis. See online [converter][converter] axes dropbox tooltips.
  * `standard` - this option change the XPath generation of a class attribute selector '[class operation value]'. See [Class attribute non-standard](https://angezid.github.io/css-to-xpath-converter/index.html#class_attribute_non_standard) and [Class attribute standard](https://angezid.github.io/css-to-xpath-converter/index.html#class_attribute_standard). Non-standard implementation is more practical because it deals with individual classes instead of a whole `className` string.
  * `removeXPathSpaces` - strips unnecessary space characters from the XPath (they are added for readability).
  * `printError` - the callback to send error message that the converter is detected, e.g. in online [converter][converter] it is printed in the XPath editor.
  * `debug` - log the converter errors to the console (the converter catches its errors internally).
  
  * `uppercaseLetters` - custom uppercase letters string, using by converter to perform case-insensitive attribute value and text operations.  
  It extends the default uppercase Latin alphabet. It must be compliant with `lowercaseLetters`.
  
  * `lowercaseLetters` - custom lowercase letters string, using by converter to perform case-insensitive attribute value and text operations.  
  It extends the default lowercase Latin alphabet. It must be compliant with `uppercaseLetters`.
  
  The default options:
  ``` js
  const options = {
    axis : '//',
    standard : false,
    removeXPathSpaces : false,
    uppercaseLetters : '',
    lowercaseLetters : '',
    printError : (message) => {}
    debug : false
  };
  ```
